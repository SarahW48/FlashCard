Flashcard App (native app):

User Case:
1) Add a flashcard,
2) Edit text, image and video to the flashcard,
3) Delete the flashcard,
4) Send the flashcard to your friends (the new feature I add)

FYI: I recorded a video on iOS simulator to show the use cases of the app. 


The technology I used:
React Native (building the native app based on Javascript and React)
Realm (mobile database)

In order to run the app, the following packages are required:
